There are some datasets available. We build dataset01 (using main_build_dataset.py) for training purposes and dataset_opera (using main_build_dataset.py) to verify the model generability. <br>

The procedure to achieve a good model is: <br>
a) start the training using model_adam_200 (main_train_adam.py)  <br>
b) complete the training changing to main_train_lbfgs resulting in model_adam_lbfgs model <br>
c) pay attention to the loss terms evolution to set a better set of weights <br>

The notebook main.ipynb demonstrates the model capability during free prediction <br>

Feel free to contribute with the software improvements.
